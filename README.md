# Oracle Sequence and Trigger Generator
Ok. So you have your DDL created in Oracle. Maybe you migrated from another database. Then you realized something important: You don't have an autoincrement id.

This script is a nice tool that generates your sequence ddl as well as all the sequence ddl for each of your tables. Definitely a nice time saver if you have a large amount of tables.

Enjoy, and let me know if you have any comments or concerns.
